## Knowledge Graph based Phenotyping on Heterogenous/Distributed Data Sources
- towards interpretable, reusable, reproducible phenotype computation in clinical data science.
- a project funded by Health Data Research UK

### Why & What
Extracting patient phenotypes from routinely collected health data (such as Electronic Health Records) requires translating clinically-sound phenotype definitions into queries/computations executable on the underlying data sources by clinical researchers. This requires significant knowledge and skills to deal with heterogeneous and   often *imperfect* data. Translations are time-consuming,  error-prone and, most importantly, hard to share and reproduce across different settings. This project implements a **knowledge driven phenotyping framework** that  
1. decouples the specification of phenotype semantics from underlying data sources; 
2. can automatically populate and conduct phenotype computations on heterogeneous data spaces. 

This framework has been deployed on five Scottish health datasets.
